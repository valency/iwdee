Upholding all that is right and good is a crusade that knows no boundaries, and it chafes at the spirits of those who understand the only real morality is dictated by those with the strength and will to rule. In the cities and towns of Faer√ªn you can feel false morality creeping into the hearts and minds of the sheep that worship at temples rather than taking what is rightfully theirs. You have chosen a different path, a better one: your patron is darkness, your morality the end of your blade, your cause the despoiling of the world.

In the dark, cold parts of the world are hidden vaults containing avenues to power that even you have not yet conceived; and in the untamed wilderness of the North, unguarded by the passage of man, you have rightly identified an opportunity to make early claim to whatever power awaits you.
