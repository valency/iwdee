Books and years of study are the purview of mages whose power is locked behind walls of memory and formulas. For those with the blood of a dragon in their veins, however, all that schooling seems a profound waste of tuition. You learned your magic by exploring the fiery power of your draconic ancestry, and although you don't know as many spells as a scholar hiding behind a tome, your power is limited only by the strength of your bloodline.

Unfortunately, a duel with an adept from the local college has earned you a violent reputation; at the urging of the local guards and a few friends, you have “decided” to leave the bustling city for a trip to the North. Perhaps they think a few years in the cold will tame your burning spirit, but on the frontier you spot the true opportunity: to grow in power and discover what it truly means to be a descendant of dragons.
