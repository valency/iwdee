The study of magic opened your eyes, not just to the arcane arts, but to the world itself. With every spell you learned in college, every scrap about magic and the arcane arts that you absorbed, you were fascinated with how each piece of information carried with it a certain history, a window into another land or the writings and mind of another practitioner of magic. It was not long before the libraries and the halls of the college began to seem oppressive, more like mausoleums than places of learning. You did not want to meet the fate of some of the elderly college scribes and librarians, lost within their books—you wanted to travel, see what the world held for anyone with a passion for exploration and knowledge. You didn't want to spend your life reading of other's discoveries—you wanted to make some of your own and allow others to benefit from it. 

Shortly after graduation, you set about planning your travels. Who knows what lost knowledge lies within the wilderness of the North, simply waiting for someone to uncover it?
