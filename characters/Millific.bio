It's a well-known saying that a life lived without purpose is not worth living. Many people believe this, but they never seem to understand that sometimes a client may decide he doesn't agree with the purpose they've chosen for themselves. Sometimes a client pays good money to have them dealt with, and when they do, you always find your pockets lined with gold. Almost always, that is. Someone saw you this time, and they weren't happy about your choice of targets. Maybe they didn't see you clearly enough to identify you to the authorities, but sooner or later someone will identify the poison's ingredients and trace them back to their source. The city guards don't take kindly to those who make their living on the murder of high-profile nobility.

So, with a heavy heart, you have left the shadows and rooftops of your home, and decided to take an extended vacation to the North. Perhaps in a few years they'll forget about the man you killed and it will be safe for you to return to your client for your payment, but until then, you'd much rather see what new contracts the frontier towns have to offer. After all, a life lived without purpose is not worth living.
