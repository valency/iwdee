Less than a fortnight after your initiation ceremony into the Temple of Lathander, you were summoned before the Dawnmaster of your order. In warm words fitting for a follower of the Morninglord, she gave you your first assignment as a member of the clergy: to travel to the frontier towns of the North and bring the light of the Morninglord to the people that make the harsh environments their home. Almost as an afterthought, she spoke to you of portents and omens concerning events transpiring in the North, and it was the belief of the temple that a representative of their interests there might serve to soothe potential troubles in the region.

Though these missions to the untamed wilderness are often considered an unwanted chore by the less optimistic members of your order, you found yourself eager to accept the task. It seemed to be a chance to bring hope and light to the people of the North, a chance to do some real good rather than settling into weekly services delivered for the temple's casual worshipers in the city. Without hesitation, you agreed to make the pilgrimage, and within a tenday, you embarked on your journey North, with only a staff in hand and the light of the Morninglord in your heart.
