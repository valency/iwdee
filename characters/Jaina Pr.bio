Less than a fortnight after your initiation ceremony into the clergy, you were summoned before the head of your temple. In a cordial, if somewhat cold meeting with the high priest, you were assigned your first duty as a full member of the temple: to make a pilgrimage to the North and see if you could spread the faith to the frontier towns. Almost as an afterthought, the high priest informed you of his "concerns" over portents and omens concerning events transpiring in the North, and it was the belief of the temple that a representative of their interests there might serve to soothe potential troubles in the region.

Though these pilgrimages are often considered an unwanted duty by the more politically minded clergymen of your order, you found yourself eager to accept the task. It seemed to be a chance to bring enlightenment to the people of the North, a chance to make a difference rather than falling in a routine and simply presiding over the usual services within the temple. Without hesitation, you agreed to make the pilgrimage, and within a tenday, you embarked on your journey North, with only a staff in hand and the doctrines of your faith firmly etched in your mind.
